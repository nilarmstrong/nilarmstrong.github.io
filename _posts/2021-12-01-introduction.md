Hi, we are students from Korea, and are interested in cybersecurity. We belong to BoB(Best of the Best) which is a government supported 8-month program  that trains passionate students to become cybersecurity experts. You can find more information about BoB from the link below.

During the process of doing BoB, we organized a team - 'nilarmstrong' to make a security research on Lua. Some of you might not heard about Lua. Lua is a lightweight programming language that is mostly utilized on host programs in embedded form. As the language is not quite popular, there wasn't much information on how to make a research, such as useful methods on finding vulnerabilities, fuzzing, etc.

In this blog, we posted our experience with Lua researching. For some of you who is interested with security aspect of Lua, it would be helpful to refer our posts.
